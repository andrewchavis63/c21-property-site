## Sections
- Sticky navbar, Hero (stat counters), Services (6 cards), Why Choose Us, Team, Contact, Footer

## Blog Architecture
- Posts stored in a `const posts` JS object keyed by id (e.g. `'featured'`, `'tar-representation'`)
- `openPost(id)` renders post content in a modal — triggered by `onclick` on cards
- Featured card is a separate section from the posts grid; filter tabs only filter grid cards
- To make a post filterable, it must be a `.post-card` in the grid with a matching `data-cat` attribute
- **GOTCHA:** A `DOMContentLoaded` block previously injected images from `posts.featured.img` into `.featured-img`, overwriting hardcoded HTML images. That block has been removed — images are now hardcoded in HTML. Do not re-add dynamic image injection.
- Blog card order = newest → oldest by date

## Blog Post IDs & Dates
- `tar-representation` — March 2026 (featured + grid)
- `featured` (FW Market post) — March 2026
- `saginaw` — March 2026
- `seller-mistakes` — February 2026
- `absentee` — January 2026
- `first-time` — January 2026
- `rates` — December 2025
- `azle` — November 2025

## Filter Tab → data-cat Mapping
- `buyers-tenants` → Buyers & Tenants (tar-representation, first-time)
- `market` → Market Updates (featured/FW Market, rates)
- `sellers` → Seller Tips (seller-mistakes)
- `neighborhoods` → Neighborhoods (saginaw, azle)
- `investing` → Investing (absentee)

## Conventions
- Always include `&reg;` after "Century 21" — e.g. Century 21®
- Keep it vanilla — no npm, no bundler, no frameworks
- Mobile-first, responsive

## Shell / Environment
- Bash paths must use Unix format: `/c/Users/achav/c21-property-site` — Windows paths fail

## TARRENT — Current State (2026-04-06)
- 12 posts live — always verify count before referencing post numbers
- No photo reuse — grep filename across all `TARRENT/*.html` before assigning hero image
- Supabase edge fn: `curl -X POST https://zksjjekaiscwkmiibbqp.supabase.co/functions/v1/<fn> -H "apikey: <anon>" -H "Authorization: Bearer <anon>"`
